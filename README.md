# ASConverter
Convert images into ASCII art and customize to your own preference.

This will quickly and hastily covert any image of accepted types to ASCII art.

# How to use
In the "Input" directory, import an image file that is an accepted type. Run the ASConverter shortcut or the .exe file. Type in the name of said image file. You may specify a "clarity" value which impacts pixel mean value. >1 makes the image brighter. <1 makes the image darker. It's better to keep the clarity at 1 if you don't know what you are doing. Then, the file will be converted once the program reaches %100. In the "Output" directory, you will see a .txt file with the name of the image you created. For best products, open the file in notepad and set the font size to 1. Images are recommended to be 124x124 or around that size as the text may be too big for your screen.

# Accepted files

Currently, ASConverter only accepts files with the following extensions: bmp, png, tga, jpg, gif, psd, hdr, pic and pnm. However, I have only tested out jpg and png.
